  <h3>Background</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Blood plasma proteins have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but understanding which proteins are on the causal pathway remains challenging.</li>
    <li>This study aims to investigate the genetic overlap between candidate proteins and AD using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and interrogate their causal relationship using bi-directional Mendelian Randomization (MR).</li>
    <li>More details are available in the academic paper <a href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.21.21255751v1'>('Assessing genetic overlap and causality between blood plasma proteins and Alzheimer’s Disease')</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Analysis structure</h3>
  
  
  <p> The analysis is structured around 4 main steps </p>
